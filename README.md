### Who Can Contribute?

This project is designed for both developers and non-developers who are interested in contributing to open source. Whether you're a beginner or have some experience, you're welcome to participate and make your mark.

### How to Contribute

#### Using GitHub GUI (Graphical User Interface)

If you prefer using GitHub's graphical interface:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Click on the "Fork" button at the top right of the repository page. This creates a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.
   
2. **Clone Your Fork**: On your forked repository page, click on the "Code" button and then click on "Open with GitHub Desktop" or "Download ZIP" to clone the repository to your local machine.

3. **Add Your Details**: Navigate to the **cardDetails.json** file in your cloned repository. Click on the file to open it, then click the pencil icon to edit. Follow the format of existing JSON objects and add your details.

4. **Commit Your Changes**: After editing the file, scroll down to the "Commit changes" section. Enter a commit message that briefly describes the changes you made. Ensure the "Commit directly to the main branch" option is selected, then click the "Commit changes" button.

5. **Create a Pull Request (PR)**:
   - Go back to your forked repository on GitHub.
   - You should see a message that prompts you to "Compare & pull request". Click that button.
   - Review the changes you made. If everything looks good, click "Create pull request".
   - Add a title and description to your pull request explaining your changes, then click "Create pull request" again.

6. **Wait for Review**: Once your PR is submitted, the project maintainers will review your changes. You might receive feedback or requests for revisions before your contribution is accepted.

#### Using Command Line (Optional):
If you prefer using Git from the command line interface (CLI), follow similar steps but use Git commands for cloning, adding files, committing changes, and pushing to your forked repository.
